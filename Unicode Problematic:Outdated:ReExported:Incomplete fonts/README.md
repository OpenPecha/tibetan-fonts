# Renamed or copied font? 

## Uni-BZDMT

Uni-BZDMT is the same as FZZWMSTOT--FounderType Tibetan Art, except the ཾ (0F7E) and  ྃ (0F82) are different. 
BZDMT stands for Bandzhida Meiti (Bandita Art/decorative). FZZWMSTOT stands for Zhangzheng Zangweng Meishuti (FounderType Tibetan Art. 
I suspect that this is a renamed file of FZZWMSTOT. 
BZD, which stands for Banzhida (Bandita), is a popular non-unicode font family but I have not seen a Unicode font of BZT. 


## Sambhota Unicode: Sambhota Dege, Perfect/Phuntsok Tibetan, Yagpo Tibetan Sambhota Uni, and Himalaya-SN. 

Sambhota Unicode, Sambhota Dege, Perfect Tibetan and Himalaya-SB are the same font. I suspect that Sambhota Dege is the older version of Sambhota Unicode created by Tenzin Namdak and Gerry Wiener. 

Perfect Tibetan has a keyboard with the font "Perfect Tibetan". However, the font is exactly the same are Sambhota Unicode, not considering the slight difference in ligature, which could be the result of rendering during re-exporting. Nitartha, which is the type foundry of Sambhota font family, being a legitimate foundry, it is unlikely that they copied. Then it has to be Perfect Tibetan font that is copying Sambhota, but it also could be that they got permission to do so. Perfect Tibetan font cannot be properly used on word-processing softwares (Microsoft Word and Pages) on macOS machines, but can be used on Adobe software such as Adobe Illustrator. 

Another font that is the same as Sambhota Unicode is Yagpo Tibetan Sambhota Uni, which likely legally licensed the font from Nitartha and renamed it. 

This calligraphy style is from Tibetan woodblocks, likely Dege print and if my comparisons and assumptions above are right, there is only one digital font for this style: Sambhota Unicode by Nitartha. There is another one too--Himalaya-SN (R)-- but that one is again a slightly pinched Yagpo Tibetan Sambhota Uni.
