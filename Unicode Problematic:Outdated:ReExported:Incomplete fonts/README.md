# Renamed or coppied font? 

## Uni-BZDMT

Uni-BZDMT is the same as FZZWMSTOT--FounderType Tibetan Art, except the ཾ (0F7E) and  ྃ (0F82) are different. 
BZDMT stands for Bandzhida Meiti (Bandita Art/decorative). FZZWMSTOT stands for Zhangzheng Zangweng Meishuti (FounderType Tibetan Art. 
I suspect that this is a renamed file of FZZWMSTOT. 
BZD, which stands for Banzhida (Bandita), is a poopular non-unicode font family but I have not seen a Unicode font of BZT. 


## Sambhota Dege and Perfect/Phuntsok Tibetan

Sambhota Unicode, Sambhota Dege, and Perfect Tibetan are the same font. I suspect that Sambhota Dege is the outdated version of Sambhota Unicode. 

Perfect Tibetan has a keyboard with the font "Perfect Tibetan". However, the font is exactly the same are Sambhota Unicode, not considering the slight difference in ligature, which could be the result of rendering during reexporting. Nitartha, which is the type foundry of Sambhota font family, being a legitimate foundry, it is unlikely that they coppied. Then it has to be Perfect Tibetan font that is coppying Sambhota, but it also could be that they got permission to do so. Perfect Tibetan font cannot be properly used on word-processing softwares (Microsoft Word and Pages) on macOS machines, but can be used on Adobe software such as Adobe Illustrator. 

This calligraphy style is from Dege woodblocks and if my comparisons and assumptions above are right, there is only one digital font for this style: Sambhota Unicode by Nitartha. There is another one too--Himalaya-SN (R)-- but that one too seems to be a pinched version of the Sambhota Unicode.
