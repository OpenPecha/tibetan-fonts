# Renamed or coppied font? 

Uni-BZDMT is the same as FZZWMSTOT--FounderType Tibetan Art, except the ཾ (0F7E) and  ྃ (0F82) are different. 
BZDMT stands for Bandzhida Meiti (Bandita Art/decorative). FZZWMSTOT stands for Zhangzheng Zangweng Meishuti (FounderType Tibetan Art. 
I suspect that this is a renamed file of FZZWMSTOT. 
BZD, which stands for Banzhida (Bandita), is a poopular non-unicode font family but I have not seen a Unicode font of BZT.
