# CTRC fonts are older versions of Qomolangma font family

"CTRC" stands for "China Tibetology Research Center" in Beijing. The creators of the fonts are Tashi Tsering and Wangdra Gyab. 

The 6 fonts in CTRC (CTRC-Betsu, CTRC-BT, CTRC-Drutsa, CTRC-HT, CTRC-Tsumachu, and CTRC-Uchen) are the same as 6 fonts in Qomolangma font family consisting of 17 fonts. Judging from the dates, (CTRC font family was released in 2008, while Qomolangma was in 2014) CTRC fonts were later integrated into the new font family or branding of Qomolangma. Thus, CTRC fonts are older files of Qomolangma font family. In other words, CTRC font family was updated into Qomolangma font family. The updated fonts of CTRC in Qomolangma are as follows:
