# Yesang Karmo is an outdated name of Bhozuk font family

The first font released by the young Tibetan graphic and type designer Bho Dorchang (penname) was under his branding "Yesang Karmo", 
but after the release of his three fonts, he updated the font family with 5 other fonts and named the family "Bhozuk", whic is "Bho Dorchang + Yigzuk", 
meaning Bho Darchang's fonts in Tibetan. Yigzuk is calligraphy or fonts in Tibetan. 
Yesang Karmo-Bhodor 02 and 03 were updated and renamed to Bhozuk Ranyama and Bhozuk Lagdrima. 
The first one--Yesang Karmo-Bhodor 01--remained the same. I did suggest the designer to rename it as "Bhozuk Berdrima", meaning brsuh stroke. 
How do I know these? you may ask. Well, I translated all his font names into English phonetics, as he requested.
