# Biggest Misconception in Tibetan Typography Terminology and the "Himalaya" Font Family 

The font family named "Himalaya" is just widespread misinformation. There is no legitimate font family named "Himalaya". 
But there is a font called "Microsoft Himalaya" and a big font family called Qomolangma, which is just the same root name for "Himalaya" in Tibetan. 
Adding to the misconception is the coincident of naming of the famous Tibetan keyboard: Himalaya. 

As a result, Microsoft being one of the earliest Tibetan Unicode fonts, and all these Tibetan fonts and keyboard having the same root name "Himalaya", 
many Tibetans have the misconception of thinking that "Unicode Tibetan fonts" are called "Himalaya fonts". Many people asked me for "Himalaya fonts",
when I gave them Microsoft Himalaya and Bigger Himalaya, they are not satisfied. Later I was told and realized that they are referring to "Unicode Tibetan fonts". 

I believe that the above-mentioned coincidence in the naming of the fonts and keyboard is one collection of the reason for this misconception. 
The other two are a lack of education in typography (unfamiliar with the naming of fonts being "Himalaya") and the renamed and re-exported fonts 
titled "Himalaya A through M are mostly Qomolanma fonts with a mix of Monlam and TCRC (Tibetan Computer Research Center, not CTRC--China Tibetology Research Center). 


Below is a list of the actual names of the fonts following what each of these renamed/re-exported files called "Himalaya": 

- All four of "A-Himalaya", Himalaya-A, "Himalaya0", and "Himalaya_2" are Microsoft Himalaya!
- "Himalaya-B" is Qomolangma-Uchen Sutung or CTRC-Uchen (CTRC-Uchen is an outdated version of Qomolangma Uchen-Sutung)
- "Himalaya-C" is Qomolangma-Drutsa or CTRC-Drutsa (CTRC-Drutsa is an outdated version of Qomolangma-Drutsa)
- "Himalaya-D" is Qomolangma-Tsumachu or CTRC-Tsumachu (CTRC-Tsumachu is an outdated version of Qomolangma-Tsumachu) 
- "Himalaya-E" is Qomolangma-Betsu or CTRC-Betsu (CTRC-Betsu is an outdated version of Qomolangma-Betsu) 
- "Himalaya-F" is Uchen or DDC-Uchen
- "Himalaya-G" is Jomolhari
- "Himalaya-H" is Tibetan Machine Uni
- "Himalaya-I" (both of them) are TCRC Youtso Unicode
- "Himalaya-J" is Monlam Uni Ouchan2
- "Himalaya-K" is Monlam Uni Ouchan1
- "Himalaya-L" is Qomolangma-Tsutong
- "Himalaya-M" is Qomolangma-Chuyig
- "Himalaya-SN" is a slightly pinched Yagpo Tibetan Sambhota Uni, which is likely legally licensed the font from Nitartha.

Thus, I conclude that this re-exporting of these fonts into a single name--Himalaya--is the other biggest reason that led people to think that 
Unicode Tibetan fonts are called "Himalaya fonts", which is totally a misinformation and I would add, unfortunate.
