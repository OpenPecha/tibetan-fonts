These are legacy Tibetan fonts from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) in Pune - these were used in their ISCII system for Indian Languages (Which also included support for Tibetan).

The encoding of Tibetan in Unicode v. 1.0  was also based on ISCII - but later dropped. The C-DAC / ISCII system was  stack based system so combined letters usually required 2 or more characters

In Bhutan this system was mostly used by the courts and the police. In India I think it was used by the Central Institute for Higher Tibetan Studies in Sarnath and maybe by some agencies in Dharamsala. It was used by the Tibetan Libraries in Dharamsala and Sarnath for cataloging.

The earliest versions of this system required inserting a hardware add in card in PCs for display and ran on Xenix operating system with  bit mapped fonts - This  was used because it worked with some early Database programs whereas several other early Tibetan systems could only be used for text processing.

Iâ€™m familiar with the CDAC people and their GIST bitmapped text handling products from the late 80s and early 90s. >It was a graphics card with EPROM bitmap fonts for glass teletype displays.
 
I met Mohan Tambe the lead engineer, and Paul Bascaro, their linguist, at a UNESCO conference at IIT Pune in 1992 and helped them extend their code page to be compatible with Bhutanese requirements as they were trying to sell into government departments.
