These are legacy Tibetan fonts from C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) in Pune -
These were used in their ISCII system for Indian Languages (Which also included support for Tibetan)

The encoding of Tibetan in Unicode v. 1.0  was also based on ISCII - but later dropped.

The C-DAC / ISCII system was  stack based system so combined letters usually required 2 or more characters

In Bhutan this system was mostly used by the courts and the police.

In India I think it was used by the Central Institute for Higher Tibetan Studies in Sarnath and maybe by some agencies in Dharamsala
It was used by the Tibetan Libraries in Dharamsala and  Sarnath for cataloging.

The earliest versions of this system required inserting a hardware add in card in PCs for display and ran on Xenix operating system
with  bit mapped fonts - This  was used because it worked with some early Database programs whereas several other early Tibetan systems
could only be used for text processing.
