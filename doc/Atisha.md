# The Atisha font

In 1996, Jita Sain Negi (1948-2009, chief editor of the Dictionary Unit in Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath, Varanasi) started to create a font for the Macintosh for use in his dictionary project ([BDRC MW1KG5422](http://purl.bdrc.io/MW1KG5422)), based on block prints. The font came to use around 1998-1999.

It was converted into Unicode by Geshe Monlam.
