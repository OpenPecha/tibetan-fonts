The Mangalam font was produced in the early 90s in Shechen Monastery in Nepal, for the edition of the 1994 edition of the collected works of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche ([BDRC MW21809](https://purl.bdrc.io/resource/MW21809)), who used "Mangalam" as his pen name. No other publication using it is known.

The story of the creation of the font has two different versions:

From Ven. Matthieu Ricard's point of view, the font was designed at Shechen based on calligraphies by Lama Pema Tashi (པདྨ་བཀྲ་ཤིས།, a.k.a. "Lama Puzi"), who took inspiration from the Derge style of calligraphy; and the technical part was done by Tony Duff.

From Tony Duff's perspective, the work on Mangalam was done during the transition from his font "Calligraphic" to "Chogyal", at a late stage when it was already quite close to Chogyal. Ven. Matthieu Ricard and Tülku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche asked for some minor changes from the font to match with Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's calligraphy. The main was the distinctive downward tsa phru. Other changes made at that time came to be integrated into Chogyal, like the bird-like yata (the left point of the yata is the beak of the bird). He continued to work on the font a little bit after the publication of the Sungbum and continued to update the Shechen publication office with the latest version of his software (TibetDoc).

Version 1.6 from 1996 as well as two different Unicode versions of the font are available in this repository.
