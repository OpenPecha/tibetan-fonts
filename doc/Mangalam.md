The Mangalam font was produced in the early 90s in Shechen Monastery in Nepal, for the edition of the 1994 edition of the collected works of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche ([BDRC MW21809](https://purl.bdrc.io/resource/MW21809)), who used "Mangalam" as his pen name.

The project was led by Ven. Matthieu Ricard; the calligrapher was Lama Pema Tashi (པདྨ་བཀྲ་ཤིས།, a.k.a. "Lama Puzi"), who took inspiration from the Derge style of calligraphy; and the technical part was done by Tony Duff.

Version 1.6 from 1996 as well as two different Unicode versions of the font is available in this repository.

The font itself was never published, but was slighly modified by Tony Duff based on suggestions by Tülku Dugu Chögyal (གྲུ་གུ་ཆོས་རྒྱལ།, b. 1946). The modified font was published under the name Tibetan Chogyal. The most visible difference between the two fonts is the tsa phru, but also some general polishing.
