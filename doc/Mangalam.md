The Mangalam font has been produced for the edition of the collected works of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche published in 1994 (BDRC MW21809). It has been produced based on calligraphies and adjustments by TÃ¼lku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche (BDRC P735), and digitization by Matthieu Ricard and Tony Duff.

Version 1.6 from 1996 as well as two different Unicode versions of the font is available in this repository.

The memory of some of the people involved is that the font stopped being used because of copyright issues and that Tony Duff produced the font Tibetan Chogyal based on Mangalam mixed with a Bhutanese typeface and claimed copyright on it. The two fonts are quite close, one of the most distinctive feature is the tsa phru and wasur.
