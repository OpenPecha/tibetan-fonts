The Mangalam font has been produced for the edition of the 1994 edition of the collected works of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche ([BDRCMW21809](https://purl.bdrc.io/resource/MW21809)), the name of the font is his pen name. It has been produced based on calligraphies and adjustments by TÃ¼lku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche (b. 1947), and digitization by Matthieu Ricard and Tony Duff.

Version 1.6 from 1996 as well as two different Unicode versions of the font is available in this repository.

The memory of some of the people involved is that the font stopped being used because of copyright issues and that Tony Duff produced the font Tibetan Chogyal based on Mangalam mixed with a Bhutanese typeface and claimed copyright on it. The two fonts are quite close, one of the most distinctive feature is the tsa phru and wasur.
