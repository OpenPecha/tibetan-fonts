The difference between Bhozuk Vijahāra (A) and (B) is as follows: 
1. The length of the descenders for letters with the subscripts ya and ra, which are long in (A) and more appropriate in (B). For example, in descendered letters with subscripts such as ཀྱ་ and གྲ 

2. The ligature for the character sha ཤ or the left side bearing space is adjusted under the tsheg that would occur in front of it in text in (B). 

Overall, version (B) is more fine-tuned and visually balanced, but version (A) is more strictly based on the original manuscript Uchen Primer, although the sample is limited.
