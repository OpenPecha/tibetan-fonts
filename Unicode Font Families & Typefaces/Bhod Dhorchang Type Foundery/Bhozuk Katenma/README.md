The difference between the Katenma A and B is just two glyphs: རྩ་ and སྤྱ་ . 
In Katenma A, the glyphs are designed according to the original script style in the manuscript. 
However, the same glyphs are modified for modern use in Katenma B, without the ligature treatment that combines the middle strokes or more strokes when the root letters are joined to the superscripts.
